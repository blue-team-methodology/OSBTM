  keywords = {Passwords, Security, Memorability, Usability, Password policy},
  abstract = {User-generated textual passwords suffer from the conflict between security and usability. System administrators usually adopt password composition policies to help users choose strong passwords. However, users often use predictable patterns to meet the strict password composition policies and to make passwords easy to remember, which in turn reduces the password strength, or write the password down, which may cause the password to be compromised. To overcome the user-generated password security and usability dilemma, we propose Optiwords, which is a new textual-password creation policy that is based on picture superiority effect, which provides users with a direct "drawing-to-text" method for creating user-friendly passwords. Optiwords helps users design separate line drawings on the keyboard as a "password figure" and choose the characters on the lines of the drawings in a certain sequence as the final textual password. A two-part user study with 127 participants was conducted to compare the usability and security of Optiwords with other three popular password policies. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference compared Optiwords with Basic8 or 3class8 in memorability. The password strength of Optiwords outperformed Basic8 and 3class8. Compared with Random8, Optiwords had a great advantage in usability.}

ABSTRACT = {As cross-border access becomes more frequent, traditional perimeter-based network security models can no longer cope with evolving security requirements. Zero trust is a novel paradigm for cybersecurity based on the core concept of “never trust, always verify”. It attempts to protect against security risks related to internal threats by eliminating the demarcations between the internal and external network of traditional network perimeters. Nevertheless, research on the theory and application of zero trust is still in its infancy, and more extensive research is necessary to facilitate a deeper understanding of the paradigm in academia and the industry. In this paper, trust in cybersecurity is discussed, following which the origin, concepts, and principles related to zero trust are elaborated on. The characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing research are analysed in the context of zero trust achievements and their technical applications in Cloud and IoT environments. Finally, to support the development and application of zero trust in the future, the concept and its current challenges are analysed.},

This Paper aims to investigate the recent works which applied Zero Trust and the reason that this framework adoption has emerged during and after the Pandemic. In this regard, a questionnaire was prepared, and its results are reported. According to its results, with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) gaining skyrocket popularity and trust, for around 60{\%} corporates, ZT Access is planned for future, while for around 30{\%} corporates, the project is in pipeline. None of the organizations surveyed have the ZTA in place. 14{\%} of organizations are uninterested in adopting ZTA. Plus, in past 2 years, the percentage of north American organizations having a ZTA on the plans to establish one in the next 12--18 months has shot up.",

pages="433--454",
abstract="Nowadays, the cost of data breaches is immense for organizations and society. Organizations can benefit from understanding the core components influencing a data breach's likelihood and impact. Zero Trust (ZT) strategies have proven to be more effective in addressing cyber risk resilience than the more traditional `implement-a-framework' approach because the ZT focus on segmenting the environment by ringfencing sensitive data sets, limiting lateral movements and reducing the potential blast radius in case of a breach. However, Zero Trust has traditionally focused on technical measures and associated verifications. In isolation, technological measures won't offer the optimal data-breach-cost-reduction. Company owners and boards that neglect their responsibilities are liable to hefty financial fines and individual liability. This paper describes how Zero Trust and Zero Trust as a Service (ZTaaS) decrease the economic impact of a data breach. It concludes with a conceptual approach that practitioners can immediately leverage to reduce the potential cost of a data breach and lower insurance premiums. Insurers can benefit from the simultaneous reduction of likelihood and impact.",

abstract = {Researchers have shown that offloading software middleboxes (e.g., NAT, firewall, load balancer) to programmable switches can yield orders-of-magnitude performance gains. However, it requires manually selecting the middle-box components to offload and rewriting the offloaded code in P4, a domain-specific language for programmable switches. We design and implement Gallium, a compiler that transforms an input software middlebox into two parts---a P4 program that runs on a programmable switch and an x86 non-offloaded program that runs on a regular middlebox server. Gallium ensures that (1) the combined effect of the P4 program and the non-offloaded program is functionally equivalent to the input middlebox program, (2) the P4 program respects the resource constraints in the programmable switch, and (3) the run-to-completion semantics are met under concurrent execution. Our evaluations show that Gallium saves 21-79\% of processing cycles and reduces latency by about 31\% across various software middleboxes.},
