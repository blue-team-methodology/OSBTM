\begin{abstract}

This research proposes a novel, data-centric approach to cyber security and is intended to bridge the gap between abstract theory and practical application. 
Grounded in a literature review of trends such as deperimeterization, zero trust, and key regulations (GDPR, nFADP), this work's primary innovation is its prioritization of data classification based on the determined data value. 
Unlike traditional service oriented approaches, this methodology dictates that all subsequent security decisions, from network topology to encryption protocols, are derived directly from an asset's assessed value. 
While foundational, the methodology's generalizability is limited by the current research sample. 
Future work will focus on developing more sophisticated data valuation models, creating detailed, actionable implementation guides, and securing a formal legal review to ensure regulatory compliance. 
This thesis establishes a practical foundation for continued research and invites community collaboration to further develop this methodology. 
This project was carried out in collaboration with the Swiss Innovative Arts \& Technologies Institute and will be published intended as an open source methodology  on GITHUB, so security professionals around the world can use it or enhance it.
